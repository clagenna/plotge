Under the pretext of studying the algorithm of Dijkstra "shortest path" I created a project that contains different programming techniques.
This kind of project may be a start point for studying some tecniques and some kind of usefull libraries.
here some of them



- **Maven** is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT. 
- **Log4J** is a Java library developed by the `Apache Software Foundation` that allows you to fine-tune with an excellent logging system, helps you monitor the behavior of an application during development, testing and finally go-live of your software. It is the *de facto* standard for logging of Java applications.
- **Lombok** is a Java library used to reduce boilerplate code for model/data objects, e.g., it can generate getters and setters for those object automatically by using Lombok annotations.
- **GSon** for serialization of data files 
- **Patterns** Here I used some patterns like Singleton, Broadcast
- **JUnit** for testing pieces of code
- **Java Swing** for building a pure (old style) client graphical interface
